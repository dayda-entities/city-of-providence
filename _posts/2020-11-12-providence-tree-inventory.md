Last updated 3/9/2016.  In 2006, a complete inventory of all the Cityâ€™s street trees, including trees located within sidewalks, between sidewalks and curbs, or within 6 feet of the street if no sidewalk existed was conducted. One hundred volunteers were trained to record address, location, tree species, tree diameter, condition, and other related information. Trees located in parks and other public property were not included. Approximately 25,000 street trees were counted and the data was loaded into a tree database that the Forestry Division uses daily to manage the trees, track tree work, and record constituent concerns.
