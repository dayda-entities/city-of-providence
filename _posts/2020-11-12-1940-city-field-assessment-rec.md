Abstract: This digitized collection contains approximately 90,000 images of Residential Assessment Records (a.k.a. “field cards”) created by the Tax Assessors Department of the City of Providence, Rhode Island. These cards contain information on structural conditions of buildings (e.g., grades of condition for foundations, walls, roofs, building materials, etc.) organized by, street address, and plat & lot number within the City of Providence.  The verso of these cards contains structural diagrams, land valuations, and cost computations.

Scope and Content: The field cards were developed as a measure to accurately grade the value of a structure for tax purposes within the City of Providence.  The strength of the collection, contemporarily, concerns the sections under “Land Valuation” on the verso of the digitized documents, particularly the status for which a building was zoned for (eg., house, apartment, industrial, or commercial structure, etc.).  This information helps distinguish the maximum amount of tenants a residential building can have within code. Other areas of interest include quality assessments from building materials to structural condition (eg., cost computation of values before and after deductions of existing conditions and improvements of a structure).

Arrangement: The field cards are digitized and arranged in the Socrata database system accessed by address + plat/lot.
